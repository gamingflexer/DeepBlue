Due to the growth of Information Technology (IT) and telecommunications sectors in the recent past, the dissemination of alert messages has become prompt and easier. Since the existing business environment faces the challenge of reaching increasingly segmented markets, the design, delivery, and analysis of business communications needs to be tightly    integrated across multiple alert notification channels. Telecommunication channels through which subscribers can receive alert messages may include email, fax, text messaging, instant messaging, broadband network and the like. Due to myriad software applications implemented by businesses and the vast demographics of customers, it may become necessary to segment alert messages so that the messages can be sent through channels based on business needs as well as customer preferences. Further, in order to maintain strong customer relationships, businesses need to time the messages precisely.

The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to create an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about how much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational risks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk and capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves appropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.  The New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital requirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage (CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are Simple VaR if the collateral is eligible. If the collateral is ineligible then the Wholesale loan approach will be utilized or the collateral will be reduced to zero in the Simple VaR. .

WAAS combines Cisco's Wide Area File Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally at LAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-based applications on a given network. \u2022 WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work together to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attempt    to communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so that they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server. \u2022 The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to optimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized \u2022 Mainly involves optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS and functional wise platform check.

Due to the growth of Information Technology (IT) and telecommunications sectors in the recent past, the dissemination of alert messages has become prompt and easier. Since the existing business environment faces the challenge of reaching increasingly segmented markets, the design, delivery, and analysis of business communications needs to be tightly    integrated across multiple alert notification channels. Telecommunication channels through which subscribers can receive alert messages may include email, fax, text messaging, instant messaging, broadband network and the like. Due to myriad software applications implemented by businesses and the vast demographics of customers, it may become necessary to segment alert messages so that the messages can be sent through channels based on business needs as well as customer preferences. Further, in order to maintain strong customer relationships, businesses need to time the messages precisely. This brief illustrates how Alert Notification System (IANS) can help organization leverage existing infrastructure to better service their customers.

The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to create an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about how much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational risks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk and capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves appropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.  The New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital requirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage (CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are Simple VaR if the collateral is eligible. If the collateral is ineligible then the Wholesale loan approach will be utilized or the collateral will be reduced to zero in the Simple VaR. .

The source information is generated by a keypad and this will be encrypted and is sent to the destination through RF communication. The receiving system will check the data and decrypt according to the specific algorithm and display on the LCD. The RF module used here are Bluetooth of 9.6 kbps which has inbuilt RF encoder and RF decoder and AT89C52 micro control unit (MCU). This encoder converts the 8bit data into a single bit and send it to the transmitter which will be transmitting. POST GRADUATION PROJECT  Project Title \u035eAnalytical RDH Approach For Image and Video Processing Using Reserving Room Before Encryption\u035f  Brief Description of the Project Reversible data hiding (RDH) approach in image and video processing is a  https://www.indeed.com/r/Aboli-Patil/643b8f3de04165ac?isid=rex-download&ikw=download-top&co=IN   technique, where the information of a original cover is recovered using lossless approach, The data extraction is done once the extraction of embedded message is successfully recovered. The applications of reversible data hiding are in medical imagery, military imagery and law forensics, where no distortion of the original content is allowed. In the reversible data hiding method, First empty room is made by embedding LSBs of some pixels into other pixels with RDH method and then encrypt the image, so the positions of these LSBs in the encrypted image can be used to embed data .In the first phase, a content owner encrypts the original uncompressed image using an encryption key. Then, a data-hider compress the least significant bits of the encrypted image using a data-hiding key to create a sparse space to accommodate some additional data. If the receiver has both key data-hiding key and the encryption key, it can extract the secret data and recover the original image.", {"entities": [[1915, 1956, "Email Address"], [950, 957, "Location"], [873, 880, "Location"], [732, 777, "College"], [720, 723, "Degree"], [632, 657, "College"], [626, 631, "Degree"], [507, 515, "Degree"], [55, 96, "Email Address"], [12, 19, "Location"], [0, 11, "Name"]]}], ["Gohil kinjal Looking for Android dveloper  IN surendranagar - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/Gohil-kinjal/f9d60e3a5b27a464  IT Professional seeking a challenging and rewarding opportunity with an organization of repute which recognizes and utilizes my true potential while nurturing my analytical and technical skills in the field of IT.
