Availability of skilled resources is always a challenge for any industry. More so for the IT industry. Potential Hires
to Job Description matching was done manually in old days. With the advancement of Machine Learning and
particularly Natural Language Processing algorithms, the task of recruiters have become easier. These
techniques probably have helped recruiters to search the proverbial needle in haystack.
Problem Dimensions

 Parse resume in varying formats (.docx, .doc, .pdf, .txt, etc) to store in a database
 Build a Parser such that it should be able to extract ROLES, SKILLS, PERIOD, EDUCATION,
COMPANIES, besides the usual attributes of NAME, EMAIL, PHONE number and store it in
database

 The Parser should also be able to build/ synthesize/ extract synopsis of the Candidate’s profile.
 Solutions will be judged on the ability to extract accurate information in the above fields in
database for different formats and filetypes of resume

The recruiter is presented an easy to use GUI to initiate contact with candidates.
